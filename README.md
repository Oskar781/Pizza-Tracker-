This project is just to show, my knowledge about coding in React Native. If you think i should delete it because of copyright just DM me. It shows an easy app to track your pizza expenses. The app doesn't have any database. Data is stored just temporarily, for demo purposes only. Actually I am waiting to place it on the Google PlayStore to show that I can work with Expo EAS. 

If you have expo installed on your machine the installation is very easy.

## Installation



```sh
npm install
npm start 
```
